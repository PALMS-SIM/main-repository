## Welcome to the PALMS Micro-Simulation Repository

The Physical Activity Lifelong Modelling & Simulation (PALMS) is a micro-simulation developed in response to major health concerns that relating to the lack of physical activity in a general population. A major study was carried out in the UK that brought together health assessment audits across a range of health conditions influenced by physical activity (cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal conditions, mental health, etc.)  These were used as the basis for PALMS.  It can be used to predict the lifelong physical activity behaviour of a population taking into account individual characteristics and their effect on physical activity over time. The model produces individual and aggregated quantitative outputs for quality of life and health conditions related costs. PALMS can therefore be used to assess the impact of physical activity on the above health conditions across the population. 

The PALMS micro-simulation is implemented in [Repast Simphony](https://repast.github.io/repast_simphony.html), a free and Open Source agent-based simulation toolkit ). It is a java-based implementation.   It also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools that allow for simulation parametrization and visualization. 

The PALMS repository is currently under-development.
